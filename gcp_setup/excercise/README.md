# Excercise with GCP Resources

We will work on the first components of the architecture we used in the end2end of the module `Cloud Intro`

In particular, we will focus on deploying the `orders-app` and the `delivery-app` in the Cloud, but we will use

## Configure Kafka Cluster

1. Type in the search bar Kafka and open `Managed Service for Apache Kafka`. Enable the API if requested to do so.

2. Once inside the Kafka service, click on `Create`

3. Give it a name like `edem-kafka-<edem-user>`
4. Select `europe-west1` as the region
5. Click on Grant to allow Kafka configure subnetworks

6. Select the default network and subnet
7. Leave the rest of the options with their default value, and click on `Create`



### Create the instance for the `orders-app`

For the `orders-app` we will create the VM instance using Google's UI as we did at the beginning of the class.

The characteristics of this instance have to be:

1. Name: orders-app-<edem-user>
2. Region: europe-west1 (Belgium)
3. Image: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) on x86/64
4. Machine type: e2-medium (2 vCPU, 1 core, 4 GB memory)
5. Disk size: 10 GB
6. Network: Allow HTTP traffic and HTTPS traffic
7. Network tag: `ejercicio-gcp-setup`

Once the VM instance is created, copy the gcloud command to log into it using a terminal in your laptop.

After you have successfully logged in, follow this steps to install docker:

1. Update de package index:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. Install the necessary packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
   ```

3. Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
   ````

4. Add Docker's stable repository:
   ```sh
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   ```

5. Update the package index again:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

6. Install Docker:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

7. Add your user to the docker group:
   ```sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

8. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

9. Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image:
   ```sh
   docker run hello-world
   ```

10. Install docker-compose by downloading the binary:
   ```sh
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

11. Apply executable permissions to the binary:
   ```sh
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

12. Verify that docker-compose is installed correctly:
   ```sh
   docker-compose --version
   ```


Now that we have docker and docker-compose installed, we can clone the repository with the `orders-app` code and run it.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mimove/EDEM2425.git
   ```

2. Change to the directory of the `orders-app`:
   ```sh
   cd EDEM2425/gcp_setup/excercise/orders-app
   ```
